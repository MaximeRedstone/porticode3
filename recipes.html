Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Place egg whites in mixing bowl and beat at high speed (speed 10*) for 30 seconds until slightly foamy. Add sugar in 2 to 3 increments until firm peaks form, about 4 minutes. Add yolks one at a time at medium low speed (speed 4*) until well combined, about 1 minute. Add sifted bread flour and matcha mixture and beat until just combined. Add mirin and continue to beat for another minute. Pour batter through a sieve into cake pan. Press with a spatula to help batter go through sieve. Tap pan on the counter to remove air bubbles. Using a spatula, smoothen the top of batter to remove any remaining bubbles. Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes or until top is evenly browned. Toothpick inserted into cake should come out clean. Remove pan from oven and drop it from a one foot height onto the counter to prevent shrinkage. Place a piece of parchment paper on a large piece of shrink wrap. When cake is cool enough to handle, lift cake up by holding the edge of aluminum foil. Turn cake upside down onto parchment paper. Peel off aluminum foil. Wrap shrink wrap over cake and leave overnight in the refrigerator (right side up) to preserve moisture in the cake and for flavor to develop. Alternatively, warm cake can also be put into a Ziploc bag with the foil and left in the refrigerator (right side up) overnight. To serve, cut off edges on all sides except the top and bottom with a very sharp knife. Then cut into thick slices using a sawing motion.<br/>

With a handheld-mixer or a stand-mixer with whisk-attachment, beat large eggs, egg yolks, honey and granulated sugar together until very thick and velvety (scrape down the bowl once in between).  The mixture should form large ribbons when the whisk is lifted, approx 8~10 min.  Sift the all-purpose flour and almond flour directly into the bowl, and gently fold the mixture together until even with a spatula.  Wash and dry the whisk thoroughly.  Then with another clean bowl, beat 2 1/2 large egg whites and 2 tbsp of granulated sugar with the clean whisk, until glossy with soft peaks, approx 2~3 min.  Add half of the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk-mixture, gently stir until evenly combined.  Then add the remaining egg whites, and fold it in gently with a spatula. Line a baking sheet, about 15″ × 11″ (38 × 28 cm), with parchment paper and rub the surface lightly with butter.  Pour the cake-batter into the sheet and smooth the surface.  Bake in the oven for 13 ~ 15 min, until a wooden skewer comes out clean from the center of the cake.  Carefully transfer the sheet-cake to a cooling rack and cool completely.

          <h6 class="recipe_minor_individual_title">Chamomile Whipped Cream:</h6>
          <p class="recipe_information">Combine 1 cup of heavy cream, chamomile and rock sugar in a pot and set over medium-low heat.  Gently stir, and turn off the heat just before the cream comes to a simmer, then let it steep for at least 5 min until the cream has turned light-yellow.  Drain through a fine sieve, and press on the chamomile to extract as much cream as you can then discard the chamomile.  Chill the chamomile cream until very cold (or to speed it up, place in the freezer and stir occasionally until very cold).

          <h6 class="recipe_minor_individual_title">To combine them:</h6>
          <p class="recipe_information">With a clean bowl and whisk, combine the chilled chamomile cream with another 1/4 cup of cold heavy cream.  Whip the cream until it holds its shape when the whisk is lifted.  Smear an even layer of whipped chamomile cream over the sponge cake, then carefully peel the cake away from the parchment and roll it from one side to the other.  The cake-roll may feel a bit soft at this point, which is why I like to wrap it firmly with the same parchment, and chill in the fridge until cold again before serving (dust with powdered sugar on top if you like).  It keeps in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. <br/>

          <h6 class="recipe_minor_individual_title">Shortbread:</h6>
          <p class="recipe_information">Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Lightly grease a 20x20cm/8x8 inch square baking tray. In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric mixer until soft. Add the sugar and tea to the butter and beat until light and fluffy. Add the flour and mix so it comes together into a dough. Press evenly into the base of the prepared tin and push down gently with the back of a spoon. Bake for 20 minutes or until lightly golden. Allow to cool completely.

          <h6 class="recipe_minor_individual_title">Rooibos Caramel:</h6>
          <p class="recipe_information">In a pan, heat the condensed milk with the rooibos leaves until hot but not boiling. Remove from the heat and allow to infuse for 10 minutes. Pour the condensed milk through a strainer over a bowl and discard the leaves. It’s fine that tiny bits of leaves will still be left in the condensed milk. Return the milk to the pan and add the butter, sugar and syrup. Gently heat until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved, stirring occasionally. Increase the heat and boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Be careful as it will become extremely hot. Allow it to stand for 1 minute off the heat, then carefully pour over the cool shortbread. Allow to cool completely and firm up.

          <h6 class="recipe_minor_individual_title">Chocolate Topping:</h6>
          <p class="recipe_information">Break the chocolate into small pieces and melt - either in short bursts in a microwave or in a bowl over a pan of simmering water (don’t allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water). Pour evenly over the cold set caramel and allow to cool completely before cutting into squares or fingers. <br/>
